# Getting Started with smartPY IDE

This project's  smart contract is built using smartPY to implement on TEZOS blockchain.

## After building the smart  contract.

 Make sure that you must have temple cryto wallet account with some TEZOS coins.
 you can fetch free coins on (https://faucet.marigold.dev/).

 ### Smart contract Deployment.
   
   After builting error free smart contract,deploy your smart contract on preffered test networks.
   I preffered Jakartanet network.
   And verify you deployment on (https://better-call.dev/)"TEZOS CONTRACT EXPLORER ".

### MINT YOUR FIRST NFT MANUALLY
  
  Search your contract address on (https://better-call.dev/) and mint your first NFT with proper metadata.
  
### FRONTEND DEVELOPMENT
 
 Build your frontend using react.js

Installation

To get the project up and running, and view components in the browser, complete the following steps:

    Download and install Node: https://nodejs.org/
    Install project dependancies: npm install
    Start the development environment: npm start

Development

When developing components, you may want assets automatically compiled and the browser to refresh automatically. To do this, run the following task:

    npm run dev

Creating a static build

To create a static instance of this project, run the following task:

    npm run build

This will create a folder called www, into which the required files will be created.
Deployment

To make this project publicly accessible, you can deploy a static instance by running the following task:

    npm run publish

Run "npm start" for running your react app.

## INTEGERATION
 
Now, integrete your smart contract with the  developed frontend code.
The following must be attained to run the minting process,
 1)  smart contract address
 2)  api key
 3)  wallet address
 4)  RPC url
 5)  Network name."# hello world"
